# Notes to Remember

## Description

This project is a notetaker application that uses a JSON "database" file to store information for the notes app. The backend javascript logic communicates with the database file and displays it on the frontend webpage. I built this project to further my understanding of Routes and server functionality while tying in previous knowledge. This project allows the user to store their notes for whatever occasion in a secure location outside of local storage on their machine. I learned a lot about GET, POST and DELETE operations.
